function y = fast_conv_add(x, h, L)
% fast_conv_add: Implements fast convolution using the Overlap-Add method.
%
% ALGORITHM PRINCIPLE:
% The Overlap-Add method performs convolution of a long signal with a short filter
% by processing the signal in blocks and using the convolution theorem:
% convolution in time domain = multiplication in frequency domain.
%
% PROCESSING STEPS:
% 1. BLOCK SEGMENTATION: Divide input signal x into blocks of length L
% 2. ZERO PADDING: Pad each block and filter h to FFT length N = L + M - 1
% 3. FFT COMPUTATION: Transform both block and filter to frequency domain
% 4. FREQUENCY MULTIPLICATION: Multiply FFT results element-wise
% 5. IFFT COMPUTATION: Transform back to time domain
% 6. OVERLAP-ADD: Add overlapping portions from adjacent blocks
%
% ADVANTAGES:
% - Computational complexity: O(N log N) vs O(NÂ²) for direct convolution
% - Memory efficient for long signals
% - Suitable for real-time processing
%
% INPUTS:
%   x : The long input signal vector (any length)
%   h : The filter impulse response vector (typically much shorter than x)
%   L : The processing block length (affects memory usage and efficiency)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   y : Convolution result with length = length(x) + length(h) - 1
%
% COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS:
% - Number of blocks: ceil(length(x)/L)
% - FFT operations per block: 2 (forward) + 1 (inverse)
% - Total complexity: O((length(x)/L) * N * log(N)) where N = 2^nextpow2(L+M-1)

        Block_X = my_fft(block_x_padded);
        
        % Perform frequency-domain multiplication.
        Block_Y = Block_X .* H;
        
        % Compute the inverse FFT to get the block convolution result.

        % Add the convoluted block to the corresponding section of the output vector.
        % This correctly handles the overlapping regions between blocks.
        if y_end > length(y)

            y(y_start:y_end_limited) = y(y_start:y_end_limited) + block_y(1:(y_end_limited - y_start + 1));
